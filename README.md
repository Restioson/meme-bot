# Installation
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.5 or higher and add it to your `PATH`. On Windows, during the installation you can tick an option to do this.
2. In a shell or `cmd` window, type in `python --version`. If the output looks something like `Python3...` then you are ok! If the output says that you are running Python 2, make sure you have removed this from your PATH or use an absolute path instead of `python`.

2. Install pip (if not preinstalled) and add it to your `PATH` (or equivalent)
3. In a shell or `cmd` window, type in `pip3 install discord.py` and press enter
4. Download the latest stable release of Meme-Bot from [here](https://github.com/Restioson/meme-bot/releases/latest)
5. Extract it
6. Open a shell window
7. `cd` to where the downloaded folder is
8. Type `cd meme-bot-master` and press enter. Do this twice
9. To run the bot, type in `python meme-bot.py`. The bot will only work if it is running. You can set it up to start on startup if you prefer, but this is outside the domain of this tutorial.

# Compatability
This bot *should* be compatible on all OSes supporting Python 3.5 or later. However, Meme Bot will only auto-discover memes in `C:\Users\user\Pictures\Memes` on Windows.
