## Howto

*Note: the gif is slow due to my internet speed. If your internet is faster, it will send the memes faster.*

# FAQ
** Help! I have a problem**

Have you:
1. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Restioson/meme-bot/wiki/Commands)
2. Read the [guide](http://imgur.com/gallery/B5Qfu)
3. Read this FAQ

If the answer is yes to all three, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Restioson/meme-bot/issues/new) with the [question](https://github.com/Restioson/meme-bot/labels/question) tag, or contact me on discord: Restioson#8323.

**Help! What is a Discord user API token?**

This is your secret string that you can use to let selfbots send messages and do other things on behalf of you. You will need to give this to the bot so it can a) read messages send to you to listen for commands and b) send memes for you. I won't send this to anyone else, nor read any of your messages, but you can check it out in the [code](https://github.com/Restioson/meme-bot/blob/master/meme-bot.py#L41) if you like.

**How do I get it?**

There is a guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/5ncwpv/localstorage_missing/dcalpi1/). Thank you to [/u/DJScias](https://www.reddit.com/user/DJScias) for this wonderul short tutorial.

**How do I add a meme folder?**

In discord, type in `~addmemefolder C:\Path\To\Memes` under Windows, or `~addmemefolder /path/to/memes` under Mac/Linux/Other *nix.

** My meme isn't showing up or sending! **
1. Make sure that you named it something with keywords in the filename
2. Make sure that you didn't add the file extension in the `~meme` command
3. If it's a new meme, try typing `~reload` and trying again
4. Make sure that you added enough keywords to the `~meme` command.

**How do I report a bug?**
